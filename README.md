# Coding for the first time since 1980-something. 
I'm officially vintage

## About Me
A 47-year old geek who's still continuing to learn new things.

Despite working in Technology for the last 25 years, and being sure that I was never going to be a coder, and didn't need to ever learn "all the Developer stuff like Github" - I find that DevOps and Cloud technology has caught up to me... and isn't just "servers in the cloud".

While I'm not resistant to change... it's been eye-opening just how much more mature processes can be. It's a brave new world (with apologies to Mr Huxley), and while I'm a little trepidatious to be learning such completely alien-seeming concepts, I'm determined to at LEAST learn the basics, because I can very clearly see the potential value here.

I doubt I'll ever be very active on anything public - so good luck finding any good commits in my history. But I'm certainly open to anyone that might want to cheer me along. :)
